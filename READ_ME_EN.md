# SÉRAPHIN ∞

**Fractal self-evolving hydra · Symbolic simulation · Code as living system**

SÉRAPHIN ∞ is an open-source, educational simulation exploring fractal recursion, emergent behavior, and symbolic learning.

Every agent is a complete hydra. Every hydra is a fragment of the whole.

This project sits at the intersection of code, systems thinking, and generative art.  
It is **not** a product, **not** a trading bot, and **not** meant for real-world deployment — it is a sandbox for ideas.

### How a non-coder brought this to life

SÉRAPHIN ∞ was born from an idea — not from thousands of lines of code written by a professional developer.

The author (Lucien Mandel) does not code professionally.  
The entire concept, architecture, simulations, and code were co-created through conversations with AI assistants (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini).

If you have an idea but "don't know how to code":
- Describe it clearly.
- Ask AI to prototype, simulate, refine.
- Iterate until it lives.

No gatekeeping.  
Ideas > technical skills.

This project proves it.

✨ **What is this?**  
SÉRAPHIN ∞ models a recursive system in which entities can:  
- spawn other entities (fractally)  
- adapt their behavior based on experience  
- influence the global system through shared memory  
- generate visual artifacts (Julia sets) that reflect the system’s evolution  

The goal is not optimization, but observation: how complexity emerges from simple rules under constraints.

🧠 **Two versions, two intentions**

1️⃣ **CORE** — the clear foundation  
Purpose: clarity, pedagogy, intuition  
- Minimal fractal recursion  
- Shared collective memory  
- Energy-limited growth  
- Symbolic behaviors  
- Julia set visualization  

Ideal if you want to understand the system quickly.

2️⃣ **ULTIMATE** — the exploratory extension  
Purpose: depth, emergence, research  
Builds on CORE and adds:  
- Epigenetic learning  
- Symbolic fractal consensus  
- Future-echo feedback loops  
- Controlled combinatorial growth  
- Optional quantum-inspired stochastic core  

This version is denser and more experimental.  
📄 File: `seraphin_ultimate.py`

CORE is the map. ULTIMATE is the expedition.

🌀 **Visual output: Julia sets**  
Each simulation generates a Julia set image — a symbolic representation of infinite tentacular growth.

🚀 **How to run**

```bash
# Core version
python seraphin_core.py --simulate

# Ultimate version
python seraphin_ultimate.py --simulate

# Ultimate with quantum-inspired mode (educational simulation)
python seraphin_ultimate.py --simulate --quantum-force
